are trying to reinvent relationships with the hope of finding one
that fits their purposes.  Relationships have been around for a long
time.  Rather than following tried and true principles, people are
wandering out on their own to search for something new.  People are
trying to satisfy their desires.  Selfishness, or wanting to do
things their own way, causes people to look in the wrong places to
fulfill this desire.  People end up getting hurt, or just end up
settling for less than what is possible in their relationships. 
Doing things a better way, though no guarantees for success, can make
your odds of having the type of relationship that works for both
parties more obtainable.</FONT></FONT></P>
