   Moody was born in Northfield, Massachusetts on February 5, 1837. 
At the age of seventeen, he headed for Boston.  There he joined the
Mt. Vernon Congregational Church.  At this time, he was employed as a
shoe salesperson for his uncle.  It was in Boston that Dwight’s
life-long affiliation with the YMCA (Young Men’s Christian
Association) started.    He eventually left Boston and moved to
Chicago.  In Chicago, his relationship with the YMCA continued.  He
continued to work as a very successful shoe salesperson right up
until he decided to quit the business world.  He dedicated himself to
full-time ministry in 1860.   </FONT></FONT>

      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A leading
Methodist newspaper reported on the new energy for witness among lay
people, with Christian faith becoming a common topic.  One of the
most notable transatlantic products of the revival was a member of
Plymouth Congregational Church in Chicago, who from 1858 (he was 21)
was hiring large halls and was soon attracting 1500 children.  This
young man, Dwight L. Moody, was to go on to have a remarkable
interdenominational and international evangelical ministry, giving up
his business in 1860 to devote himself full-time to work with young
people and children, later broadening his work and becoming a mass
evangelist.(Randal, 2009, p. 219-220)</FONT></FONT></P>

   The YMCA played an important role in Moody’s life.  “The Young
Men’s Christian Association was founded in London, England, on June
6, 1844, in response to unhealthy social conditions arising in the
big cities at the end of the Industrial Revolution (roughly 1750 to
1850)” (YMCA of Rowan County).  Findlay stated this about the
purpose of the YMCA, “To seek converts and thus new members of the
denominations, and to expand the moral influence of the churches
throughout society” (Findlay, 1969, p. 71).  Moody took on many
roles at the YMCA in Chicago.  He started as the first unpaid
employee.  Moody moved up the ranks from janitor to president.  He
spoke at many of the YMCA conventions throughout the country.  The
connections he established were his door to doing revivals in
England. (Findlay, 1969)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>5
     Moody attended the Plymouth Congregational Church in Chicago. 
He also started spending time with a young men’s group from the
First Methodist Church.  This group would visit saloons and hotels on
Sunday mornings to try to get people to attend church services.  In
early 1859, Moody started a non-denominational mission Sunday school
to try to reach children.  He also hoped that this would lead to
opportunities to minister to the parents.  He would wander the
streets looking for children to attend the school until 10 or 11 PM
every night after work.  The work started to take too much time and
Moody decided to quit his job and go into ministry full-time.  The
school was eventually in need of larger facilities.  A new school and
church was built to support the growing ministry. John V. Farwell, a
Chicago dry goods merchant, along with others (Cyrus McCormick,
William E. Dodge, George Stuart), financially supported the ministry
Moody started. (Findlay, 1969)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>6
   In June 1873, Moody left Chicago with Ira Sankey and headed to
England to do revivals.  Findlay reported, “He lost interest in
everything except the preaching of Christ and working for
souls”(Findlay, 1969, p. 132).  Moody held revivals all over
England and Ireland.  After 2 years, Moody headed back to Northfield,
Massachusetts.  This became his primary residence for the rest of his
life.  Because of the media attention he received during his time in
England, he returned to the United States a folk hero.  Many
communities were soon requesting Moody to do revivals.  Moody did
revivals in Brooklyn, Philadelphia, New York, Chicago, Boston,
Baltimore, St. Louis, San Francisco, Atlanta and Kansas City.  There
were also two more trips to England to do revivals.  The last revival
Moody spoke at was in Kansas City just before his death in 1899.
(Findlay, 1969)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>7
   Moody started three schools devoted to Christian education.  The
Northfield Seminary for young women was started in 1879.  In 1881,
the Mount Herman School for Young Men was founded.  (Findlay, 1969) 
The Chicago Evangelization Society (later renamed to Moody Bible
Institute) was started in 1886 for the following reason, “He
wanted, he said, to make it possible for “a man without any
education,” who had “a passion for souls” and no “means to
get ‘em,” to get the education he needed to work effectively for
God” (Findlay, 1969, p.330).  </FONT></FONT>

   Dwight L. Moody was a man with a purpose.  He devoted his life to
evangelism.  He had a desire to reach souls for God.  This led him to
quit his job and enter full-time ministry.  He started three schools
for the purpose of Christian education.  He sought lost souls his
whole life by doing revivals.  Through his preaching, many heard the
message.  He did all these things to try to save America and the
British Isles.  <BR></FONT></FONT><BR>
