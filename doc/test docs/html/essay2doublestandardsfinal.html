<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What is a
double standard?   Dictionary.com describes double standard as the
treating of one group of people differently than another group when
they both do the same thing.  Males and females are often treated
differently when they exhibit the same behavior.  Valenti pointed out
how men and women are viewed differently when anger is displayed. 
Men are taken seriously and women are on the rag (Valenti, 2008).   </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Valenti
provided a very good description of this double standard.  She had an
argument with her boyfriend and in an effort to invalidate her
position; he exclaimed that she was “going soap opera”.  She said
that this caused her to believe that she was being overly dramatic. 
In this instance, the boyfriend was to be taken seriously when he
became angry and she was not (Valenti, 2008).  Even though both
parties displayed the same emotion, the female was the one that was
not to be taken seriously.  Was the male going “soap opera”? 
Most would not see it that way.  He was being assertive.  This
illustrates the double standard.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There are other
situations where anger is interpreted differently by the sexes. 
Mazzulo presents the following event.  A few couples were having
dinner at a restaurant.  The service and the food were terrible and
one of the women complained and demanded that the bill be reduced. 
The other couples were embarrassed when the female spoke up.  Mazzulo
asks if they would have reacted the same way if the husband had been
the one who had complained (Mazzulo). </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Where could
this double standard come from?  Barkacs and Standifird mention a
management study where managers were asked to list eight
characteristics of great leaders.  The results were interesting. 
Female managers mentioned recognizing strengths, fairness,
appreciation, and accessibility.  Male managers included
aggressiveness, confidence, and objectivity.  The different genders
had different results for the same question.  Another finding
included comments that we have seen in all of the other readings. 
Females are more empathic and patient.  They also concluded that men
are seen as more aggressive and women are more cooperative.  They
mentioned that parents pass their values and beliefs on to their
children.  The experiences of the parents influence the attitudes of
the children.  If the parents married at a young age, the children
will also be more likely to marry at a young age (Barkacs &amp;
Standifird,  2008).  From the examples above, we can see that males
and females see things differently and act differently.  They have
also learned many things from the parents.  Society has a certain
expectation for the behavior of each gender.   These expectations can
be taught to the children through various methods and can be passed
on to the next generation. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Let us talk
about those expectations for a moment.  Sandler comments that we all
have expectations for the behavior of the opposite sex.  When people
do not act according to those expectations, we get uncomfortable.  He
pointed out that men are expected to act assertive, females are to be
passive, and we are uncomfortable when they act out differently.  One
response to the aggressive female is to call her a “bitch”
(Sandler, 2005).  These expectations keep the behavior alive. It is
also very effective.  Women seem to be accepting the response because
they act the same way when another female does it.  Women are
applying this standard to other females.  The behavior does not meet
their expectations of society.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Men have always
been in a position of power in society.  This could explain some of
the double standard.  Men control many aspects of the female’s
lives.  Life is very difficult for most females who do not conform. 
There is much to lose.  Men are the major money earners, run the
companies, and lead nations.  When in the position of power, the one
in power gets to make the rules.  Many men want to continue to have
that position of power and will do anything to keep it.  Stifling the
voice of the women helps to accomplish this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Another reason
for this double standard is the different physiological makeup of the
genders.  We view the world differently.  Women are more empathetic
and males are more systemizing. Males are the aggressors. Women have
traits that make them more patient and better listeners. 
(Baron-Cohen, 2003)  These behaviors (double standards) are passed on
to our children when they see the interaction between the sexes in
the family and how they are acted out in the media.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What is the
impact on society?  Double standards can be dangerous.  Valenti
believes that women will not express their anger outwardly.  Holding
the anger inside can cause many medical issues (Valenti, 2008).  Many
talented females have changed promising career paths or have just
quit trying to move ahead.  Women have been silenced when their
opinion could have brought about a different outcome.  Women see
things from a different perspective.  It is important for them to
speak up because the best decisions are made when all points of view
are taken into consideration.  Why speak up if you feel strongly
about something and know that you are not going to be taken
seriously?  The self-esteem of many women has been damaged because
they may not see themselves or their opinions as valued.  In China,
girls are not valued as highly as boys are.  As a result, many girls
are aborted due to the government policy of one child per family. 
Granted this is extreme and is not necessarily due to double
standards.  There are many economic reasons.  However, this could
lead society down that path. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>How can this be
changed?  This will be difficult since most men and women both view
aggressive females in the same way.  When a woman spoke up to
complain about bad food and service in the restaurant, both the males
and the females were embarrassed.  Both genders are stifling this
behavior.  Societies view on the “angry” female has to change. 
Society needs to be reprogrammed.  This has to occur in schools, in
the media, and at home.  All three share the responsibility to make
this happen.  Will men give up their power?  Are men willing to
share?  Women will really have to take the lead on this.  Women need
to encourage other women speak out and resist the acceptance of this
type of behavior from other women and men.  Both genders need to be
called out on this behavior when it happens.  Maybe then, the men can
be more accepting.  As women move up into positions of power, this
will help shift attitudes.  </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Being
a male, I learned a lot by studying this topic.  My wife has to deal
with this every day as a member of the work force.  Her management
group is male.  It is also a topic that congers up a lot of emotion
for her.  She first noticed this while a drum major in the high
school band.  Now, after studying this topic, I can be more aware of
this dynamic in my conversations with other females.  Men need to
react differently to treat everyone the same.  </FONT></FONT>
