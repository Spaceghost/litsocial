     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Doing something
outside my gender was not an easy assignment for me.  As I pondered
the assignment, I tried to come up with ideas on an activity that I
might have some fun with and not be too uncomfortable.  Simon
Baron-Cohen stated, “We hold different beliefs about our genders
that affect our behavior and interests” (Baron-Cohen, 2003).  There
are just some things that guys should not be doing.  As I thought
about that, a list of all of the things that my wife has an interest
in was starting to form in my mind.   After discussing potential
activities with my wife, we decided to look into attending a stamping
or card class.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>I had never
attended a card class and I was not sure what it entailed.  My wife
(Cindi) and her close friends attend these activities often.  I
inquired if she had ever seen a male attend one of these activities. 
I know I did not know any male who ever had.  She said she had not
seen any males in a class.  I began to look at this as a potential
project.  However, I started thinking about the questions I had. 
What happens at these things?  How long do they last?  What do you
end up doing?  Do I need to bring anything?  Does it cost anything? 
Will I leave with my manhood intact?    All of these questions went
through my mind.  There was one big question that I left out and it
was perhaps the most important.  Will I be seen and recognized by
someone I know?  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>I had my wife
sign us up for the class.  I did not want to surprise anyone too
soon.  I decided it would be fun to take my wife along to help take
notes and to hear what the others in the class had to say when I
stepped out to visit the men’s room.  She signed us up as Cindi and
friend.  I put July 12, 2011, in my electronic datebook.  Card class
would commence that Tuesday at 6 PM.  I would be going armed with my
double-sided tape, $10.00, and a pair of scissors.  Now I was getting
a little nervous.  Barnett and Rivers mentioned that peer pressure
would determine what is off limits for males.  They also mentioned
that stereotypes could be very powerful and cause anxiety (Barnett &amp;
Rivers, 2004).  I was beginning to feel the pressure.  I hoped I
would not run into anyone I know.  We would be making wedding cards
and anniversary cards.  </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Tuesday
eventually came and it was time to go to class.  I was a little
apprehensive about doing this as I walked from the car to the
building.  We went to the Hobby Lobby and the first thing I had to do
was ask the woman at the cash register where the card class was being
held.  She sort of did a double take and then pointed to a door
located on the far wall.  Here we go.  I walked into the room before
my wife and asked if this was the room where the card class was being
held.  The look I got from the leader (Barb) was priceless.  She
said, “Oh, I was not expecting a man.  Welcome.”  She showed me
where we could sit and then my wife and I got started.  Barb then
exclaimed, “I have been trying to get my husband to make cards for
15 years.  Now I can go home to my husband and say; Jack, real men do
stamp!”  Barb was very excited to show me how all of her little
toys worked and share all of her tricks.  Later as the evening went
on she asked, “How are you doing girls or and guy.  Sorry Bob,
you’re the first guy I have had in my class.”  </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were a
couple of other things worth mentioning.  There was a point later in
the evening when Barb asked my wife why she put down Cindi and friend
when she signed up.  Before my wife could answer, Barb inquired if it
was because she was bringing a male to the class and she was not sure
if Barb would be fine with that.  My wife just said that was not the
reason.  The other was the trip I took to the bathroom to see if any
of the women would make a comment to my wife while I was out of the
room.  To my surprise, nothing was mentioned while I was out of the
room.  I think this was due to the exceptional way that Barb handled
it.  As a result, I did not feel any gender bias in the class.  Barb
did tell us that she had heard of men attending card classes.  It
just had not happened to her.  She heard that men make very nice
cards.  Another point worth mentioning, there was very little
conversation amongst the other women attending the class.  They
seemed to be very focused on designing their cards.  I expected it to
be more of a social function.  The instructions took a little bit of
deciphering to figure out how the cards need to be constructed.  This
played right into my systemizing skills.  The Cuttle-bug also got my
interest.  Learning how to use this gadget was one of the evening’s
treasures.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the article,
“Doing Gender”, West and Zimmerman point out that we are seen as
male or female by the activities we are doing in society.  We do
gender.  It is how we behave and not just our biological differences.
 To be considered male or female we need to act a certain way. 
Society determines what is normal (West &amp; Zimmerman, 1978).  So
society will interpret our activities and label us as male or female.
 Certain activities in society are seen as things that either males
or females do.  The pressure that society can put on each gender to
act a certain way can be enormous.  </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>One thing I
learned doing this project is that if I buy a Cuttle-bug, I need to
use a 40% off coupon.   After the class was over, I did not have the
heart to tell Barb that I did this for a class project.  She was
truly excited to have a guy in her class.  I think she would have
been disappointed to know my real reasons for doing it.  Her husband
Jack was going to get an earful when she got home.  Participating in
that conversation would have been fun.  I did make it out of the
class without being recognized.  After making five cards and having a
fun time doing it, if I was recognized it would have been fine.  My
wife and I really enjoyed the evening.  Would I do it again?  What
would I do with all of the duplicate wedding and </FONT></FONT>
