<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Philip
Knight started to figure out a way to make his dream a reality while
finishing his master’s degree at Stanford University.  This dream
started out in 1964 as Blue Ribbon Sports, Inc.  He then co-founded
Nike, Inc. which was started in 1971 (Krentzman).  Nike’s climb to
the top has not been without issues.  They have dealt with overseas
labor issues and other controversies.  In fact, Nike thrives on
controversy.  It keeps them in the news (Answers.com Philip Knight:
Biography).  Krentzman stated, “Nike’s analog isn’t the
conservative team owner, but the cocky superstar who sets the agenda
and is so wildly popular he knows he can get away with just about
anything” (Krentzman).</FONT></FONT><IMG SRC="Group%20Paper%20Phil%20Knight%20draft5_html_m452fc717.jpg" NAME="Picture 2" ALT="tc-at-hq-sm.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=12 WIDTH=176 HEIGHT=176 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
textbook defines leadership as the influencing process of leaders and
followers to achieve organizational objectives through change.  There
are five key elements of leadership.  The elements include
leaders-followers, influence, organizational objectives, change, and
people.  Each of these elements will be analyzed as to how they apply
to Philip Knight, who is the owner of Nike.</FONT></FONT><IMG SRC="Group%20Paper%20Phil%20Knight%20draft5_html_m23da38fe.jpg" NAME="Picture 1" ALT="tc-headshot2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=12 WIDTH=168 HEIGHT=253 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	First,
the leader-follower and the way this applies to Knight.  He started
out in the follower position.  Knight wanted to start his own shoe
company as he was about to graduate from college, so he had to follow
what shoe makers were already doing and take from it his own
approach.  In the end, he has built one of the largest shoe companies
in the world (Knight: 'GSB was Transformative' Phil Knight, Nike,
with Dean Robert Joss , 2009).  Second is influence.  Knight has
shown influence because Nike is always coming out with new types of
shoes, which shows that employees support the new ideas (Lussier &amp;
Achua, 2010).  Third are organizational objectives.  Knight had one
objective and it was to start a shoe company.  The organizational
objective is now part of the company’s vision, which is, “To
bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world”
(Sandy).  His employees must know this because of how successful the
company is today. The next element is change.  Knight is all about
change because of the innovative things he has done with the company
and how it has grown over the years.  Knight started out just selling
shoes and is now into almost everything (Krentzman).  The last
element is people.  If Knight were not able to do all these other
things, then he most likely would not have started a company, thus
showing that when someone enjoys what they do, success is achievable.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The
next thing we will look at, in reference to Philip Knight, is his
leadership management roles.  The one that applies the best is the
decisional roles (Lussier &amp; Achua, 2010).  The first reason this
is chosen, is that he started out as an aspiring entrepreneur who
wanted to start a shoe company (Knight: 'GSB was Transformative' Phil
Knight, Nike, with Dean Robert Joss , 2009).  The disturbance-handler
role is exposed as he deals with the employees of Honduras
(Greenhouse, 2010).  He applied the resource-allocator role as he
came up with new products and services through innovation
(Krentzman).  The last role is the negotiator, which has already been
addressed in his disturbance-handler role, as in the article, the
information came from talks about union contracts (Greenhouse, 2010).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Now
we will talk about Knight’s level of analysis.  The textbook talks
about three levels and the one that applies to Knight is the
organizational level (Lussier &amp; Achua, 2010).  The reason is that
Philip Knight is Nike.  The organization comes from the vision he had
about owning his own shoe company and through innovation, creating it
into what it is today (Krentzman).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	After
analyzing the five elements, it would be appropriate to study the Big
Five Dimensions of Traits and determine how Philip Knight uses these
traits.  One of the traits used by Knight is a sense of surgency.  In
the beginning, he was an eager student with a plan.  Knight created a
plan to develop a small business designed to make a splash in the
running shoe market, since there was only one dominant business at
the time.  After graduating, he was able to make his plan a reality,
by traveling to Japan and visiting a manufacturer of less expensive
running shoes.  Knight convinced the company to allow him to import
their shoes into the United States (Entrepreneur, 2010).  At that
time, Knight was selling shoes out of his car.  Years later, he
decided it was time to start his own business after he encountered
legal issues with the manufacturing company in Japan (Inc., 2009). 
Through all of these journeys, Knight had to have a sense of
surgency.  He was also an extravert and exhibited dominance among his
character traits.  Over time, after the business was up and running,
Knight had lost his sense of surgency.  He became known for being
very private and even introverted.  His office is rarely visited by
anyone within or outside the company (Gall, 2005).  When analyzing
Knight’s career, it is apparent that he knew when a sense of
surgency was necessary.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Another
trait Knight used was the conscientiousness personality dimension. 
There were two times when Knight had stepped down from active
supervision.  Both times the company was doing well and he felt he
could leave the company in the hands of others (Roth, 2005).  During
these times, the company had taken a downward turn.  It was not as
profitable as it had been when Knight was in charge.  When he saw the
company was not doing as well, Knight returned, making it as
profitable as it was before (Roth, 2005).  He had to work hard and
make an effort to accomplish his goals by restructuring the company
to be successful.  Through this, he was responsible and dependable
while making the necessary changes to build up his empire once again.
 </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Last
of the Big Five Dimensions of Traits used by Knight was openness to
experience.  He allowed other people to make the decisions, rather
than rely on him (Heller, 2008).  If people did go to Knight with
questions, he would either not answer them or he would give an
opinion reserving the right to change his mind the next day if he
wished (Heller, 2008).  This was one of Knight’s many nonconforming
ways of management.  On one occasion, the vice president of special
projects approached Knight with a new design for a jacket.  Knight
looked at it and laughed.  The vice president of special projects
took his laugh in stride and proceeded with the jacket, which turned
into a huge success (Roth, 2005).   With Knight allowing people to
make their own decisions, this gives the business room for
imagination and growth.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Subsequently,
leadership styles will give additional understanding to Knight’s
techniques.  The University of Iowa came up with two basic leadership
styles.  Knight falls under the democratic leadership style.  Nike
uses a decentralized approach.  Roth describes it this way, “Instead
Knight did what he does best: find and motivate talented people, then
let them do their thing&quot; (Roth, 2005).  The employees are
empowered to make the day-to-day decisions.  His philosophy became,
employ people that are excited about the product and then let them
handle the details.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Another style, the
University of Michigan Leadership Model, makes a determination
between job-centered and employee-centered behavior.  Knight uses the
employee-centered leadership style.  He hired the type of person he
would enjoy hanging around with.  Roth mentions, “He liked to see
the passion” (Roth, 2005).  When his son passed away, he encouraged
his management team to spend more time with their families.  He made
the plea because you cannot make up for the time lost as a parent. 
Balancing your life between work and home is difficult.  This example
reflects employee-centered behavior.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Next,
the Ohio State University Leadership Model has four leadership
styles.  High consideration and low structure would fit Knight’s
style.  He focuses more on the people rather than getting the task
done.  He is a good communicator and shares the decision-making
responsibility with the management team.  It is widely communicated
that most of the managers at Nike do not know what Knight really
does.  He kind of sits back and lets everyone else run the company. 
When employees run an idea by him, it is common for him to say
nothing.  The managers have learned to take that as a “yes” and
move forward (</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Roth,
2005</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Furthermore,
the Leadership Grid theory looks at the concern between production
and people.  Which one of the five best fits Knight?  The
country-club leader would be the best fit.  Roth mentions that the
company practically runs on autopilot.  He is more of an
inspirational leader.  Managers handle the day-to-day operations. 
Knight wants to employ the best people, motivate them, and he
constantly reorganizes staff.  He rotates people into different
positions.  By doing this, everyone has a chance to be in multiple
roles and is capable of commenting on other parts of the business. 
To be successful at Nike, you need to develop relationships and come
up with ideas (Roth, 2005).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	What
does Knight do to motivate employees?  Motivation of employees is a
key component to the success of any business.  He puts his faith in
the employees.  They are the key to getting things accomplished. 
Since he started the company from scratch, he has many stories to
tell.  He uses the stories about how they made it through the good
times and the bad as motivation.  Most of the people on staff have
been athletes who have performed at high levels.  Knight uses their
passion and desire.  Nike has a great tradition and now they (current
employees) are at the center of it. (Roth, 2005))</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When
Knight and Bowerman decided to expand their operations from Blue
Ribbon Sports to the next level, of what would be now known as Nike,
they could not do it alone.  They definitely needed to do some
networking to locate certain individuals who were experts in their
field.  When talking about experts, Knight wanted to connect with the
best athletes in their perspective sport.  Why did he do this?  He
figured that if people would see their favorite athlete wearing their
products they would then go buy their product.  Knight explains, </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
            <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>We just
tried to get our shoes on the feet of runners. And we were able to
get a lot of great ones under contract – people like Steve
Prefontaine and Alberto Salazar – because we spent a lot of time at
track events and had relationships with the runners, but mostly
because we were doing interesting things with our shoes (Willigan,
1992).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There
is no doubt that Knight had something working for him at Nike as they
started to use sports figures for their marketing/networking
campaigns.  This creative path of networking with high profile
athletes was just the beginning for them.  Knight elaborates,</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
            <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the
early days, when we just had a running shoe company and almost all of
our employees were runners, we understood the consumer very well.
When we started making shoes for basketball, tennis, and football, we
did essentially the same thing we had done in running.  We got to
know the players at the top of the game and did everything we could
to understand what they needed (Willigan, 1992).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Knight’s
ability to maintain his network of high profile athletes is what
elevated Nike to the top of the shoe making game. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While developing
your network, it is important to be able to sell yourself in what is
called the “One-Minute Self-Sell” and no one can do it better
than Nike and their ads. When Knight was asked in an interview about
why they use famous athletes he explained, “You can’t explain
much in 60 seconds, but when you show Michael Jordan, you don’t
have to.  People already know a lot about him.  It’s that simple”
(Willigan, 1992).   Knight has continued to use this philosophy
throughout the company and now they can endorse, pretty much, any
athlete who is at the top of their game.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Innovation
is a trait of great leaders and of great companies.  Philip Knight’s
innovation has led Nike to being one of the most successful, cutting
edge companies in the world.  The Contingency Leadership Model is
used to determine if a person’s leadership style is task-oriented
or relationship-oriented.  These models can be used to match the
leader’s style to maximize performance.  Philip Knight’s
leadership style leans a little more towards the
relationship-oriented side of the Contingency Leadership Model. 
According to nikebiz.com, Nike has a Global Diversity &amp; Inclusion
Department whose mission is to harness diversity and inclusion to
inspire ideas and ignite innovation.  This phrase emphasizes how Nike
and Philip Knight created a relationship oriented approach with the
employees and how they value their ideas and promote creativity.  The
website also has a phrase, “We value every voice around the globe
and strive to hear these voices firsthand.”  Employees love working
for leaders that feel like they are valuable assets to the company.  </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	
In chapter 5 of the textbook, they talk a lot about leadership
styles.  Phil Knight encompasses a few of these styles including
supportive, participative, and achievement-oriented.  When analyzing
Knight, the supportive leadership style can be argued either way.  He
is supportive in the fact that he puts a lot of stock into his
employees for creative ideas.  Also, he doesn’t fully support the
American employees because of all of the outsourcing that Nike does
overseas.  Knight is a participative leader in the fact that he still
lets his employees be involved and makes them feel like their ability
is high.  This creates a high level of satisfaction with the
employees.  Phil Knight is achievement-oriented because he provides
both structure and consideration for the employees to get optimum
results with the products that they are producing.  </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Phil
Knight is a leader who has accomplished great things throughout his
life.  He started out by selling shoes from of the trunk of his car,
to creating the most popular, thriving company.  We were able to get
a better understanding of Knight and his success by going through the
five key elements of leadership, the Big Five Dimensions of Traits,
the different leadership models, leadership grid theory, how he
motivates employees, networking, innovation, and the different
leadership styles.  After reviewing all of these different
characteristics, it is apparent why Philip Knight has been successful
throughout his career.</FONT></FONT></P>
