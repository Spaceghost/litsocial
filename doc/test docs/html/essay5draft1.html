   Roundabouts need community support to be included as part of the
planning in the future of a community.  The architects of our cities
need to help us embrace necessary changes as the world expands around
us and shapes our environment (Livingston, 2005).  When the public is
not educated, roundabouts fail at the city committee level since the
public comes out against them.  There are many examples of this.  The
following comments came from a Brookfield, Wisconsin Council meeting:</FONT></FONT></P>

  How do you get the information out there?  The Wisconsin Department
of Transportation, knowing how important education is to a successful
implementation of roundabouts, has put together brochures, videos,
and simulation software for this purpose.  They can give
presentations at public forums to help people understand how
roundabouts work and what makes each particular intersection feasible
for a roundabout (Wisconsin Department of Transportation, 2008, p.
11.26.15).  There is also plenty of information available on the
internet at www.dot.wisconsin.gov.</FONT></FONT></P>

      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Roundabouts:
An Informational Guide, “roundabouts are circular intersections
with specific design and traffic control features.  These features
include yield control of all entering traffic, channelized
approaches, and appropriate geometric curvature to ensure that travel
speeds on the circulatory roadway are typically less than 50 km/h
(about 25 mph)”.(Long, Guth, Ashmead, Emerson, &amp; Ponchillia,
October 2005)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Traffic
moves in a counter clockwise direction.  Figure 1 shows traffic flow
and crosswalks.  Yield signs are typically posted near the entrance
to reinforce the idea that those vehicles currently navigating the
circle have the right of way.  Some other significant features:</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.25in; text-indent: -0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Roundabouts
have splitter islands on each approach.  These islands, shaped like
elongated triangles and made of concrete or painted on the roadway,
separate the entry and exit lanes of a street.  Crosswalks usually
cut through splitter islands at the street level.  Splitter islands
help to slow down traffic as it enters and exits the roundabout by
deflecting it from a straight-line course.  They also provide a
pedestrian refuge midway through a street crossing.(Long, et al.,
October 2005) </FONT></FONT>

   Safety is a major concern for traffic controllers.  “Richard
Retting, senior transportation engineer at the Insurance Institute
for Highway Safety, said most of the studies show roundabouts can
reduce accidents by at least half” (Slevin, 1999).  Data shows that
roundabouts reduce the number of severe injuries versus traditional
intersections (Long, et al., October 2005).  Since the design of the
roundabout causes traffic to slow, vehicles are traveling at slower
speeds if an accident takes place.  Another life saving
characteristic is the angle of the vehicles at the time of impact. 
The angle is important because it is rare to have a head on collision
or a life threatening broadside accident with the use of a
roundabout.  Roundabouts also make it real obvious to all drivers who
has the right of way versus other types of intersections (Wisconsin
Department of Transportation, 2008).    </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>6
  When considering roundabouts as an alternative to traditional
intersections using traffic control lights, cost is part of the
equation.  Roundabouts offer many cost benefits:</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.25in; text-indent: -0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Since vehicles
approaching a roundabout do not have to stop due to the fact that
they are controlled using yield signs, there is also a reduction in
delays and unwarranted stops.  The potentially continuous flow of
vehicles across intersections via a roundabout translates into a
reduction in both gas consumption and tailpipe emissions – hence
environmental benefits.  Traffic signals might run over a full
24-hour period even when their use is not warranted, but roundabouts,
due to the way conflicts are managed, allow delays to be reduced at
all periods of the day.( Nétu, 2009, p. 23)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
mayor from Caramel, a suburb of Indianapolis, told Brown County
residents and government employees that stoplights cost $150,000
each.  By installing roundabouts they save on electricity and
stoplight costs.  He also estimated that 150,000 gallons of fuel is
saved on their six roundabouts each year (Walter, 2009).  The reduced
number of severe accidents also reduces costs.  Environmental costs
are very difficult to measure but still beg for consideration.  All
of the costs need to be considered when replacing a controlled
intersection with a roundabout.  According to the Wisconsin
Department of Transportation, these costs include construction cost,
maintenance cost, delay cost, engineering cost, and crash cost
(Wisconsin Department of Transportation, 2008).  </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>7
    Roundabouts can have a profound effect on the community aesthetic
value.  The center island of a roundabout can put to artistic use. 
They can be landscaped to include whatever the community desires. 
The roundabouts can also be designed with brick, stone, pavement, or
any other material to enhance the look.  Stoplights and poles can be
eliminated to clear the landscape of undesired images.  Since
roundabouts reduce idling, quick starts, and encourage lower speeds,
noise and air pollution are also lowered (Wisconsin Department of
Transportation, 2008).  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>8
    Another major reason to put in a roundabout is traffic flow,
since it can reduce delays.  Major accidents can close major
intersections and cause delays.  Roundabouts reduce the number and
the seriousness of collisions so the flow of traffic has reduced
interruptions.  When the power goes out, roundabouts are still
functional due to the way they are designed.  They rely on yield
signs. There is no more waiting for a traffic light in the middle of
the night when no one is around. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>9
    Many communities, when challenging the installation of
roundabouts, threaten to sue or bring up the issue of accessibility
for pedestrians.  Many use the concern over pedestrian traffic to
block construction.  Many advances have been made in this area. 
“Planners researched how to make roundabouts compliant with the
Americans with Disabilities Act</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>1</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
and, Hansen said, believed light signals, sound strips, raised
crosswalks and other safety improvements could create a safe crossing
for pedestrians” (Block, 2009).  Accessibility for trucks is also a
concern for some.  The center part of the roundabout includes an
apron for truck traffic by design.  This should alleviate any issues
for larger vehicles. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>10
   Roundabouts can be used to assist communities with traffic flow
and meet other varieties of needs, if the public gives them a chance.
 History has shown that getting the first roundabout into a community
can be the hardest.  Once they are exposed to it and take advantage
of the benefits it offers, many communities build many more.  The
town of Howard has five roundabouts on Lineville Road alone.  Many in
the community were against them at first.  Many more intersections
have been replaced with roundabouts and more are planned.  During
this budget conscious time, many communities are looking for ways to
save money, make their community safer, and resolve traffic flow
problems.  Roundabouts could be the answer.  With a little bit of
education and planning it can happen.</FONT></FONT></P>

an inventory of the communities around Green Bay, many are planning
construction of roundabouts.  The Military Avenue project to replace

were designed to do.  This community can and should be used as a
model.</FONT></FONT></P>
