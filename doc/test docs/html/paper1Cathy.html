<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>S.
Truett Cathy is a unique man, a great leader, and an example for all
leaders to emulate.  He is the founder of Chick-fil-A restaurants. 
He started the company in 1967 and he has operated the company using
Biblical principles.  One of the things for which Chick-fil-A is best
known for is being closed on Sundays.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Cathy
started out in the restaurant business in May of 1946 with his
brother, Ben.  They opened up the Dwarf Grill in Hapeville, Georgia. 
His brother, Ben, died in 1949 and he bought the rest of the business
from Ben’s wife.  The restaurant was renamed to the Dwarf House. 
Goode Brother Poultry Company had scraps of boneless, skinless
chicken and approached Cathy.  He decided to play around with the
scraps to see if he could find a way to use them.  He came up with a
seasoned sandwich, which he called Chick-fil-A.  The first store
opened in 1967 at Greenbriar Mall in Atlanta.  </FONT></FONT><IMG SRC="paper1Cathy_html_m22be9c63.jpg" ALT="tc-headshot2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=12 WIDTH=166 HEIGHT=224 BORDER=0>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Since
Cathy started out on his own, he had to perform all of the managerial
roles.  For the figurehead role, he is the CEO of Chick-fil-A.  He
forms joint ventures with independent operators instead of selling
franchises.  He also takes on the leader role.  He meets with all
potential operator candidates.  He looks at the commitment to the
operators as he would a marriage.  He makes sure to pick them
carefully.  He spends a lot of time training the operators and they
end up being very loyal to him.  He looks at Chick-fil-A as extended
family.  The liaison role is also part of what Cathy does.  He
believes in service to others.  He has been a mentor to young people
for half a century.  Many of the kids he mentors end up working in
careers at Chick-fil-A.  He believes in community service.  He uses
his role to train up young people and be a role model.  </FONT></FONT><IMG SRC="paper1Cathy_html_ma7d2b52.jpg" NAME="Picture 2" ALT="tc-at-hq-sm.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=12 WIDTH=242 HEIGHT=176 BORDER=0>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
informational role has three parts.  The monitor role is one of the
key areas.  Cathy meets with all the leadership at Chick-fil-A. 
Through his internal meetings, they were able to focus on their
purpose.  Their purpose statement is, “That we might glorify God by
being a faithful steward in all that is entrusted to our care, and
that we might have a positive influence on all people that we might
come in contact with (ChristiaNet).”  The disseminator role is
important to Cathy.  Whenever he makes a business decision, he looks
at how it will affect his extended Chick-fil-A family.  He is very
loyal to his employees. Like every CEO, he communicates quality and
customer satisfaction.  Cathy also handles the spokesperson role.  He
is the leader of this organization since they never went public.  By
keeping it in the family, he is able to control the growth.  He is
also able to make sure the stores stay closed on Sunday.  He will not
compromise on this area.  He also is a spokesperson for the
organization.  He has written two books and many interviews on his
leadership ideals.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
decisional roles played a big part in the early development of the
Chick-fil-A organization.  The entrepreneur role helped Cathy develop
a product that many consumers love and continue to enjoy.  He
developed the sandwich that the company is founded on.  The
disturbance-handler role was also important early on.  Many obstacles
had to be resolved for Cathy to be where he is today.  They were
trying to start their first restaurant immediately after World War
II.  There were shortages of nails, lumber, and meat.  Cathy and his
brother had to use nails that they found and straightened, then
locate some used lumber, and a special deal had to be made with
another local restaurant to provide meat.  All of this had to be done
to get things rolling.  The resource-allocator role was used while
trying to scrounge up the money to start the business and trying to
determine the growth path.  Cathy quickly determined that the
Chick-fil-A stores needed to be located in malls to keep the costs
down.  He was able to get the first store going for $17,000.  He
decided to keep expanding and it took seventeen stores before he
started making money.  The negotiator role is the last of the
decisional roles.  Cathy is the owner of the business so he can do
what he wants with his company.  He has negotiated many things over
his long career.  Since he puts other people before himself, he
negotiates fairly and people respect him.  He has many employees and
customers who are extremely loyal to him.  This role is easy because
of the principles he has chosen to live his life by.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Which
managerial role is Cathy’s biggest strength?   The leader role is
where the loyalty is engrained in the operators and everyone else who
spends time with him.  He definitely influences people.  He has
developed Christian principles in the lives of many young people. 
The entrepreneurial role is also a strength.  He has managed to come
up with a unique advertising campaign, which uses cows to sell
chickens.   He has not changed this strategy because it is still
working.   </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Of
the three levels of analysis of leadership theory, Cathy operates at
the individual level.  There is a distinct relationship between Cathy
and each individual at the operator level at Chick-fil-A.  He also
desires to make a difference in the lives of every employee,
customer, and the community.  He does not open his stores on Sunday
to allow employees to spend time with their families.  This has also
attracted a high quality employee work force.  He also believes in a
servant style leadership. He runs his business using biblical
principles.  Because he operates at the individual level, employees
are very loyal.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
behavior leadership theory is most relevant when examining Cathy’s
leadership style.  He leads by example.  When his business was
faltering, he took a pay cut to avoid having to lay off employees and
affect their families.  Every employee is treated with respect. 
Employees love to go to work and customers are noticing that.  The
main purpose is to impact lives on both sides of the counter and the
profits will be there.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Big Five Model of Personality traits are surgency, agreeableness,
adjustment, conscientiousness, and openness to experience.  Which of
these traits exemplify Cathy?  Cathy does have surgency.  He has
specific ideas on how he wants Chick-fil-A to be managed.  He does
not compromise on these ideals.  His main goal is not competing but
influencing people.    He also has strong agreeable personality
behavior.  He puts other people ahead of himself and genuinely cares.
 He has chosen this life style.  His decisions consider other
peoples’ situations.   The adjustment trait has to do with
emotional stability.  He has a tremendous desire to be a model
citizen and an example to the people he mentors.  Self-control is one
of the many character traits the Bible addresses.  To influence
others positively, self-control is a requirement.  He has been
teaching Sunday school for half a century.  He has influenced many
lives.  Cathy also has conscientiousness as a trait.  He gets things
done.  Running an operation requires hard work to get things
accomplished.  Cathy is not afraid of hard work.  When he opened his
first restaurant with his brother, it was open 24 hours.  They each
worked a 12-hour shift Monday through Saturday.  He also has many
goals for the community.  He has awarded over 16,000 employees
company scholarships.  Openness to experience is being willing to try
new things.  When Cathy started out, he tried something new.  His
leadership style is something different to many in the business
community.  Now that he has been successful with his current business
plan for so long, he has not changed much.  It seems as though he
will continue with what works, like his advertising campaign (uses
cows to sell chickens).  His concepts are very different.  He is very
successful, so why change.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What
traits does Cathy have as an effective leader?  Cathy definitely has
the dominance trait.  He likes to be able to control the inner
workings of the business.  He wants the company to stay on the path
of applying the biblical principles it started with.  He had the
opportunity to sell off the business but decided that he needed to
stay in control to make sure the employees were taken care of
properly.  He could have walked away a very rich man at the time.  He
definitely started the business with high energy.  He put in many
hours getting the business off the ground.  He is still very involved
even though he is in his eighties.  He also is a very positive
person.  He did not give up when obstacles were put in his path. 
Integrity is his biggest strength.  He is very concerned about the
welfare of his employees.  He has done things that have hurt him
financially to refrain from hurting his employees.  In tough times
during the early 1980’s, he did not take a salary when times were
hard, so he did not have to lay people off.  How refreshing is that? 
He truly lives by the servant principles taught in the Bible. 
Because of his integrity, he has a very loyal workforce.  His
employee turnover is very low.  Another trait Cathy possesses is
sensitivity to others.  He has influenced many lives over his
lifetime.  Whether through Sunday school, scholarships, mentoring
young people, or his company succession plans, he is always trying to
influence people’s lives for the better.  The other traits of an
effective leader are flexibility, intelligence, locus of control,
stability, and self-confidence.  Cathy possesses these traits though
they probably did not have the greatest impact on his success.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>How
does the Achievement Motivation Theory apply to Cathy?  Like all of
us, he has the need for achievement, need for power, and need for
affiliation.  The dominant trait is the need for achievement.  He is
always striving to make life better for those around him.  He is not
afraid of hard work and gets things done.  This trait can be compared
to the Big Five trait of conscientiousness.  He takes the welfare of
his employees personally.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Does
Cathy have Leader Motive Profile?  He has a high need for
achievement, a moderate need for socialized power, and a moderate
need for affiliation.  He does not have Leader Motive Profile since
his need for achievement is higher than his need of power. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Attitude
is important to leaders.  Positive attitudes are a good predictor of
job performance.  Cathy can be described as a Theory Y leader.  He
has a very positive or optimistic view of his employees and of life
in general.  He trusts his employees and that in turn can motivate
them.  He enjoys going to work.  Cathy also has a good self-concept. 
He has quite a list of accomplishments, has gone through many trials,
and came out on top.  He chose to manage his business using
principles from the Bible and has proven over his lifetime that the
principles work.  He considers himself a role model for young people.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Does
ethical behavior pay?  Cathy’s net worth is estimated to be around
$1.5 billion.  His level of moral development is postconventional. 
He has stuck to his principals even when it was painful to do so.  He
promised operators a new Ford car for a year if they met certain
objectives.  He had to give away 46 Lincolns during a tough year.  He
is a man of integrity and does the right thing for the employees. 
His uses a servant leadership style with the Bible as the standard. 
He treats others, as he would like to be treated.  Cathy would think
that ethical behavior pays.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
University of Iowa came up with two basic leadership styles.  Cathy
falls under the democratic leadership style.  He puts an operator in
charge of each store.  They are the responsible owners of that
business.  Operators are only allowed one store so they will be there
full time to make sure the business succeeds.  This helps the
building of relationships with loyal customers and employees.  He
does not need to supervise by doing it this way.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
University of Michigan Leadership Model makes a determination between
job-centered and employee-centered behavior.  Cathy uses the
employee-centered leadership style.  Every decision is made with the
employee relationship in mind.  The employee relationship is the main
concern.  This concern for employees has earned the trust and respect
that the employees have for Cathy.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Ohio State University Leadership Model has four leadership styles. 
High consideration and low structure would fit Cathy’s style.  He
lets the operators run each store and builds relationships.  He is a
good communicator and shares the decision-making responsibility with
the operators.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Leadership Grid theory looks at the concern between production and
people.  Which one of the five best fits Cathy?  The country-club
leader would be the best fit.  He believes that if you take care of
the employees, the profits will take care of themselves.  He does not
worry about the profits.  He puts the people first.  He expects good
performance because of the way he handles his employees.  He treats
them is if they are family.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Motivation
of employees is a key component to the success of any business.  What
does Cathy do to motivate employees?  The first motivation is in how
the store is set up.    Dobrzynski states, </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.19in; text-indent: -0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
    <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Chick-fil-A's
operators, who are not franchisees, put up just $5,000, a tiny
fraction of the cash required by fast-food chains for a franchise.
The risk falls on Chick-fil-A, which owns or leases the stores, rents
them to operators, collects 15 percent of sales, then splits the
profits 50-50. Chick-fil-A guarantees operators an income of at least
$30,000.(Dobrzynski, 1996)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
$30,000 base pay helps with meeting the lower levels in the hierarchy
of needs.  A store operator can earn more than $100,000.  Regular
hourly employees earn wages comparable to other fast food places and
long term hourly employees can receive college scholarships. 
Dobrzynski also reports, “He motivates them in part with the use of
cars or vacation condos. He also pays for his operators, full-time
headquarters employees and all their spouses to attend a five-day
meeting each February -- this year in Bermuda (Dobrzynski, 1996).” 
They also supplied benefits for operators and salaried workers.  The
type of motivation characterized here fits the expectancy theory. 
The performance objectives for the operators and salaried employees
are clearly defined.  Different levels of performance are rewarded
accordingly.  The employee will find value in the award types that
are offered.  The employee has to know that you will do what you say
you will do.  The Pygmalion effect has to be applied also.  This
means that when you set higher expectations, the employee will raise
their performance to try to meet the higher expectations.  This is
motivating with positive reinforcement.  When this type of
reinforcement is used both the employer and the employee win.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Chick-fil
A has a succession plan that has Cathy’s children taking over the
company after he leaves the business.  The children are being
mentored to run the business using the same principles that have been
successful to this point.  They do not see a reason to change things.
 If I had to do it all over again, I would not mind working for this
company.  The use of the Bible as guidance for running a company
makes sense.  The principles from the Bible have value in individual
lives; why not apply them in the business world?  The goal is to
glorify God and this business does.</FONT></FONT></P>
